    <body>Upgrading from Version 1.* to Version 2.* In version 2 we have added multi-currency support. First of all make sure you migrated the Price module . We have changed ZED tables to usePriceProductFacadeinstead of the database join to get price, because that requires additional business logic processing before deciding which price to display. If you changedAbstractRelatedProductTableorRelatedProductTableQueryBuilder, check core implementation and update accordingly.
