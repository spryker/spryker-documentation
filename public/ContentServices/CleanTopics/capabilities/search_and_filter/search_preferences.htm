    <body>In Zed there’s a section (Search and Filters -&gt; Search Preferences) for managing searchable product attributes. To be able to search after a product in the shop that has a specific attribute (e.g. color, size, etc.), you can click on “Add attribute to search” to create new, or “Edit” if it already exists in your list then set “full text” or “full text boosted” settings to “Yes”. After adding/updating all necessary attributes, you’ll need to apply the changes by clicking on the “Synchronize search preferences” button. This will trigger an action that searches for all products that have those attributes and were modified since the last synchronization andtouchesthem. This means that next time, the search collector execution will update the necessary products, so they can be found by performing a full text search. Synchronization Depending on the size of your database, the synchronization can be slow sometimes. Make sure that you don't trigger it often if it's not necessary. To have your search collector collect all the dynamic product attributes, make sure you also followed the steps described in theDynamic product attribute mappingsection.</body>
