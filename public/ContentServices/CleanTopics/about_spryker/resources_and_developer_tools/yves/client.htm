    <body>Yves is divided into two: The part with controllers, forms, templates etc Client part which provides access to the search and storage engine and the Zed application. The purpose of the client is to encapsulate the logic which runs the shop independent from the overlying application. So in case you want to use a different technology stack, you can reuse the client. Gliffy Source: https://www.gliffy.com/go/html5/9790869 How to use a Client in Yves getClient()method in Yves Spryker provides several clients. For instance there is a cart client which contains methods likeaddItem()orremoveItem(). And there is a catalog client which handles query strings. In each(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)you can access the related client with thegetClient()method which is available in controllers and plugins. Gliffy source: https://www.gliffy.com/go/html5/9791017 The following example shows the usage of the cart client inside theCartController. As you can see the client uses transfer objects as an input parameter. Click to expand the code sample &lt;?php
namespace Pyz\Yves\Cart\Controller; use Generated\Shared\Transfer\ItemTransfer;
use Pyz\Yves\Cart\Plugin\Provider\CartControllerProvider;
use Spryker\Yves\Kernel\Controller\AbstractController;
use Spryker\Client\Cart\CartClientInterface;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\RedirectResponse; /** * @method CartClientInterface getClient() */
class CartController extends AbstractController
{ /** * @param string $sku * @param int $quantity * @param array $optionValueUsageIds * * @return RedirectResponse */ public function addAction($sku, $quantity, $optionValueUsageIds = []) { // Get the client $cartClient = $this-&gt;getClient(); // Build a transfer object $itemTransfer = new ItemTransfer(); $itemTransfer-&gt;setId($sku); $itemTransfer-&gt;setQuantity($quantity); // Add the item: // Behind this there is a request to Zed. // The response is stored in the session. $cartClient-&gt;addItem($itemTransfer); return $this-&gt;redirectResponseInternal(CartControllerProvider::ROUTE_CART); }
} Client Execution Time You can do as many usages of the storage and search engine, but you should be aware that each call takes some time. There is a restriction for calls to Zed. Each Call to zed takes some time to start the application and perform the action. As a result the execution time of yves becomes slower. Client Avg execution time Zed 50 to 500 ms per request Elasticsearch 1 to 10 ms per search query Redis 0.1 to 1 ms per get() The real execution time in your project depends on the environment, the performance of implementation and the amount of stored data. How to Implement a Client All clients have the same structure. There is always one class which represents the client. This is quite close to the facades which we use in Zed. This class is the entry point and it usually delegates to concrete implementations which are placed in the optional subdirectoriesSearch,Session,Storage, andZed. Class Purpose Pyz\Client\MyBundle\MyBundleClient The client’s entry point Pyz\Client\MyBundle\MyBundleDependencyProvider A dependency provider to interact with other bundles Pyz\Client\MyBundle\MyBundleFactory The client’s factory Pyz\Client\MyBundle\Session\MyBundleSession A wrapper for the session Pyz\Client\MyBundle\Search\MyBundleSearch Contains search queries (e.g. Elasticsearch ) Pyz\Client\MyBundle\Storage\MyBundleStorage Gets data from the storage (e.g. Redis) Pyz\Client\MyBundle\Zed\MyBundleStub The stub connects to Zed’s corresponding gateway controller When you implement a client you should have in mind, that the client does not know about Yves. So you should not use any class from Yves there otherwise you make the client non-reusable in a different context. The client class uses the factory to create the other objects. These objects require a connecting client which they get injected in the factory. For this purpose the factory contains these prepared methods: createSessionClient() createZedRequestClient() createStorageClient() createSearchClient() Requests from Yves to Zed The request from Yves to Zed involves two important classes: Thestubrepresents the remote methods in the client. Thegateway controllerrepresents the entry point on Zed side.</body>
