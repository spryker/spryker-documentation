    <body>With Propel, a database schema is defined in an XML-file. Each(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)carries it’s own part of the big schema that is collected and merged. Propel’s documentation on defining the database schema: Database schema Example Schema XML File This file can be copied into your module into((Undefined variable: General.Bundle/Module))/Persistence/Propel/Schema/. Don’t forget to adopt it to your needs. &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;database name="zed" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="http://static.spryker.com/schema-01.xsd" namespace="Orm\Zed\Customer\Persistence" package="src.Orm.Zed.Customer.Persistence"&gt; &lt;table name="spy_customer" idMethod="native"&gt; &lt;column name="id_customer" required="true" type="INTEGER" autoIncrement="true" primaryKey="true" /&gt; &lt;column name="email" required="true" size="255" type="VARCHAR" /&gt; &lt;column name="first_name" size="100" type="VARCHAR" /&gt; &lt;column name="last_name" size="100" type="VARCHAR" /&gt; &lt;unique&gt; &lt;unique-column name="email" /&gt; &lt;/unique&gt; &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/database&gt; XML File Prefix The name of the XML file that contains DB schema definition must be prefixed with thespy_string Composed Names When you need to use a composed name for a field, you define in your table, you need to use small cases and separate the words using underscores. E.g.:category_image_name Migrations To apply a change in the database schema, you need to run a command line call. vendor/bin/console propel:install The schema migration is part of the setup:install call. The workflow can be described like this: Collect the schema-xml files from all bundles Merge schemas and copy them into one directory ( src/Generated/Propel/DE/Schema ) Generation of entities and query objects Diff of new and existing schema Run migration Schema File Merge Sometimes it is useful to add columns to a table which belongs to another(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module). Possible use cases: A core(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)wants to inject a foreign key into a table from another core(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module). This happens when the dependency direction is in contrast to the direction of the relation. A project(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module)wants to add a column to a table from a core(Undefined variable: General.bundle/module). When you add a column to a core table, this column must not be mandatory, because in this case the core classes, not knowing the mandatory fields, become unusable and thus have to be overwritten, which increases the difficulty to update. In most cases you can and should avoid adding a column to a core table. This can cause compatibility problems in the future. What happens, when the next release adds a column with the same name but another meaning? To avoid this problem it is a good practice to add a new table and use a one-to-one relationship. Merge Workflow The merging works like this: Find all schema xml files from core and project level Group them by filename Check number of files per filename If one filename has one path: copy tosrc/Orm/Propel/DE/Schema If one filename has more than one path: merge them Check if the database attributes name, package and namespace are consistent, otherwise throw exception Merge xml by the name attribute on all levels Copy merged xml to src/Orm/Propel/DE/Schema Merge Example src/Spryker/Zed/Customer/Persistence/Propel/Schema/spy_customer.schema.xml &lt;table name="spy_customer" idMethod="native"&gt; &lt;column name="first_name" size="100" type="VARCHAR" /&gt;
&lt;/table&gt; YourProject/Zed/Acl/Persistence/Propel/Schema/spy_customer.schema.xml &lt;table name="spy_customer"&gt; &lt;column name="last_name" size="100" type="VARCHAR" /&gt;
&lt;/table&gt; Merged file : &lt;table name="spy_customer" idMethod="native"&gt; &lt;column name="first_name" size="100" type="VARCHAR" /&gt; &lt;column name="last_name" size="100" type="VARCHAR" /&gt;
&lt;/table&gt; Change attribute values It is possible to change the value of an attribute e.g.type="VARCHAR"totype="LONGVARCHAR"orsize="100"tosize="200". Be aware that this can have strong side effects and should be avoided when possible. Schema Validation To avoid accidental change of attribute values, you can runvendor/bin/console propel:schema:validateafter you added thePropelSchemaValidatorConsoleclass to yourConsoleDependencyProvider. This will show you when a merge of your schema files would lead to a change of an attribute value. To give you more control about the validation of the attribute values, we added a whitelist so you can run the validator also when you have changed an attribute value on purpose. Please seePropelConfig::getWhitelistForAllowedAttributeValueChanges()for more details. Case Insensitive Fields MySQL provides case insensitive text type and this paragraph is mostly related to PostgreSql. But you still could have some benefits from using case insensitive text fields (e.g handling lower/upper case comparison on DB side). Sometime a table requires a case insensitive field. A good example isemailfield. A customer should not be able to register twice with the same email but different character case. To enable this option just setcolumnattributecaseInsensitivewithtruein a schema XML file of a target table.
